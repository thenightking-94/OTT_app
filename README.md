I am listing down all the various frameworks, libraries along with ReactJS I have used as the following :

1. CSS library --> Animista
2. Responsive frameworks --> Material-UI
3. State-management-library --> Redux.js
4. React-Redux Hooks (please refer https://react-redux.js.org/next/api/hooks)


Features and logic implemented :

1. Lazy-loading with computed-scroll management using getBoundingclientRect() browser API
2. Async data-fetch and JSON array-concatenation of Page2 at 60% threshold scroll-distance exceedance of document.
3. Async data-fetch and JSON array-concatenation of Page3 at 65% threshold scroll-distance exceedance of renewed-document-height (ie...Page1 data + Page2 data).
4. State-management using Redux.js and Redux-react Hooks.
5. Search functionality designed and logic implementation in the Reducer function in Redux_files.js
6. Theme changing facility namely (Light mode / Dark mode) implemented.
7. The back button acts as a Scroll-up button
